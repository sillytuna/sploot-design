**Vision**
Loot style lego for metaverse sports based upon fan participation rather than team building as in fantasy sports. Emphasis on humour, flexibility, and community involvement at all stages.

All development will by by and for the community. There's no company ionvolved and no grand plan.

**Sploot Association**
The Sploot Association (SA) mints the core contracts and will be responsible for manual transactions on the contracts. These may be needed to mint players, do player transfers/drafts, change data upon request by teams and arena season ticker holders (e.g. sacking a mascot, changing team colours). 

The SA will not make decisions unless absolutely necessary and will abide by community wishes/votes as appropriate. The SA's decision is final even when they made a terrible mess of it.

Initially a multisig by the mule founders then add more contributors to the multisig, then migrate to a proper dao.

**Sploot Sports**
The community will be responsible for designing and implementing sports, in whatever shape they may be. From basketball and soccer equivalents, to zombie warfare and mech battles piloted by sploot players. The SA may offically sanction certain sports.

Sports will run on a fixed schedule with seasons being a primary aspect. 1 season is the same for all sports and may last 1 month initially, with subsequent seasons starting when the SA and community have made any relevant updates and are ready to go.

Sports will likely be off-chain but provable, and will initially have the Blaseball model of being highly text based and showing live stats during games. In Blaseball people actually live stream whilst viewing the scoreboards.

**Contracts**
The first contracts will be a kept primarily about on-chain data with some extra functionality. The emphasis will be on simplicity. As seasons go by, these may be replaced or extended by the SA and on behalf of the community.

**Contract Extensions**
Third parties can extend players with additional smart contracts by allowing relevant owners to mint the extension for their nft. Teams and arenas can be extended with general data contracts or modified by their owners/season ticket holders by submission to the Sploot Association.

**Minting**
- ethereum
- free except gas
- fairer, wider distribution model than loot et al
- early supporters guaranteed sploot
- early founders/contributors guaranteed extra sploot

**Components**
- players
- teams
- arenas
- currency

**Players**
Players are NFTs owned by users. The user is their agent and we anticipate the agent may get to choose which team to join and earn fees from sports bets on their games, bribes, etc.
- randomised
- names (comedic, e.g. vanilla Periscope)
- core skills (fixed number of points randomly allocated to skills)
- fun attributes (e.g. phobias)
- personality (affects how they act in arenas)
- performance rng (blockhash based - not intended to be used in a heavy way)
- future minting possible by SA on a per season basis
- one sport and one team at a time

**Teams**
Teams are co-owned by their token holders. Through snapshot or a custom Sploot off-chain vote, enabled then by the SA, teams can make transfer decisions during transfer windows and may earn fees from sports bets, bribes, etc. Other decisions may be made more frequently if the SA can be bothered to listen, e.g. sack mascot, change name, change team colours, change arena.
- predefined data includes name, colours, rivals, mascot, arena, etc
- modifiable by SA if required by token holders
- co-owned by NFT or FT (unsure)
- managed socially and off-chain in season 1
- can recruit/sack players at fixed times during and after seasons
- can participate in multiple sports
- can have a player roster (per sport? sport defines squad?)
- play in leagues/divisions set by the sport

**Arenas**
Arenas are the locations sploot sports take place in. Arenas are fully predefined and users don't own them. Users can get season tickets, which must be renewed if they are to be kept, enabling them to earn revenues from sports bets, hiring, bribes, etc. The users form the arena crowd and sports will be encouraged to allow the crowd to participate in games to (usually) moderate effect.
- predefined data includes name, location, environment, capacity, noise, personality biases
- renewable season tickets (free in season 1)
- sports expected to support crowd interaction

**Currencies**
Sploot should have a currency which the community can build around, e.g. sports bets (cut should to to players, teams and arenas), bribes, transfer fees, etc. A second currency may be used by the crowd and as a voting system for post season changes.
- $SPLOOT: Regular currency fair minted to Sploot token owners
- $BOGROLL: limited currency possibly minted through reward system during seasons; used by crowds to affect games at arenas and post season by everyone to make changes in a sport or the sploot world generally.
