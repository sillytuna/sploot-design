# sploot-design

Sploot is a community driven project to create fun, crazy metaverse sports based around fandom. 

Inspired by loot, blaseball (not baseball) and fantasy sports, sploot will start by issuing sploot legos such as players, teams and currency. It'll then be up to the sploot community to create the first metaverse sport. Or not.
