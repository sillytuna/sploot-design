**Overview**

Enable a world of metaverse sports which emphasise community creation, participation and narrative. Technically this will be achieved by creating on-chain legos and off-chain tools, and socially there will be a highly collaborative approach to encourage good game design and economics.

Narrative emphasis will lean strongly on humour, flexibility and ugc elements. Our reference includes Blaseball (correct spelling), The Offensice Podcast (soccer), and Fantasy Sports. The sports themselves can be anything but team sports are the at the core of the project.

All development will by by and for the community. There's no company involved and no grand plan.

**Minting**

At the time of writing we suspect there will be a 10k mint of Spoot characters, including players, fans, and employees. Each of these will have different abilities and rarities. Owners of the NFTs will be part of the Sploot Association.

New characters will be minted if new teams are accepted before new seasons start to ensure ratios are always identical, and similarly new characters may be minted if the Sploot community feel we need to rebalance or e.g. add more players. The ability to scale up is important if the project is to succeed, but it will only do so with the support of the community.

No minting date has been set yet but let's say by late September and hope we don't miss!

Other smart contracts will be forthcoming after the core NFTs, including team functionality and possibly teams. Off chain voting will be possible in various contexts using custom Sploot voting tools.

**Sploot Association**

The Sploot Association (SA) mints the core contracts and will be responsible for manual transactions on the contracts. These may be needed to mint players, do player transfers/drafts, change data upon request by teams and arena season ticker holders (e.g. sacking a mascot, changing team colours). 

The SA will not make decisions unless absolutely necessary and will abide by community wishes/votes as appropriate. The SA's decision is final even when they made a terrible mess of it.

Initially a multisig by the mule founders and early contributors then add more contributors to the multisig, then migrate to a proper dao perhaps.

**Sploot Sports**

The community will be responsible for designing and implementing sports, in whatever shape they may be. From basketball and soccer equivalents, to zombie warfare and mech battles piloted by sploot players. The SA may offically sanction certain sports.

Sports will run on a fixed schedule with seasons being a primary aspect. 1 season is the same for all sports and may last 1 month initially, with subsequent seasons starting when the SA and community have made any relevant updates and are ready to go.

Sports will likely be off-chain but provable, and will initially have the Blaseball model of being highly text based and showing live stats during games. In Blaseball people actually live stream whilst viewing the scoreboards.

**Contracts**

The first contracts will be a kept primarily about on-chain data with some extra functionality. The emphasis will be on simplicity. As seasons go by, these may be replaced or extended by the SA and on behalf of the community.

**Contract Derivative**

Just as with loot, third parties can effectively extend characters with additional smart contracts by allowing relevant owners to mint the derivative for their nft. 

**Minting**
- ethereum
- free except gas
- fairer, wider distribution model than loot et al
- early supporters guaranteed sploot
- early founders/contributors guaranteed extra sploot

**Components**
- characters (nfts)
- teams
- arenas
- currency(ies) (fts)

**Characters**

NFTs owned by users. The user can be considered their agent and we anticipate the agent may get to choose which team to join or suppor, earn fees, bribes, interfere with games etc
- randomised but pregenerated to ensure fixed distribution rules
- core skills to match rookie cards for interoperability
- names (comedic, e.g. vanilla Periscope)
- fun attributes (e.g. phobias)
- personality (affects how they act in arenas)
- performance rng (blockhash based - not intended to be used in a heavy way)
- one sport and/or one team at a time; changable each season or mid season if supported by Sploot

**Teams**

Teams are co-owned by their employees/fans. Through custom Sploot off-chain voting, teams can make transfer decisions during transfer windows and their owners may earn fees from e.g. sponsorship. Other decisions may be made more frequently if the SA can be bothered to listen, e.g. sack mascot, change name, change team colours, change arena, be sponsored, etc.
- predefined data includes name, colours, rivals, arena, etc
- modifiable by SA if required by token holders
- managed socially and off-chain
- can recruit/sack players at fixed times during and after seasons
- can participate in multiple sports
- can have a player roster (per sport? sport defines squad?)
- play in leagues/divisions set by the sport

**Arenas**

Arenas are the locations sploot sports take place in. Arenas are fully predefined and users don't own them. Any user can get season tickets, which must be renewed if they are to be kept, enabling them to earn revenues the arena and to take actions. The users form the arena crowd and sports will be encouraged to allow the crowd to participate in games to (usually) moderate effect.
- predefined data includes name, location, environment, capacity, noise, personality biases
- renewable season tickets (free in season 1)
- sports expected to support crowd interaction

**Currencies**

Sploot should have a currency which the community can build around, e.g. sports bets (cut should to to players, teams and arenas), bribes, transfer fees, etc. A second currency may be used by the crowd and as a voting system for post season changes.
- $SPLOOT: Regular currency fair minted to Sploot token owners
- $BOGROLL: limited currency possibly minted through reward system during seasons; used by crowds to affect games at arenas and post season by everyone to make changes in a sport or the sploot world generally.
